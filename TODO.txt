* auto inplace buffers, if its only one ref count, you can write inplace
* hook to parallelize embarrassingly parallel blocks
* mask for ready input and output queues (& with a mask to know ready)
* source blocks (no inputs) should perform work in a separate actor/thread
because source blocks can potentially block forever on IO
* set affinity calls for each task
* affinity for each buffer
* tasks can be smart about affinity and downstream

* allocators for input ports
(where topology is smart and replaces upstream block's output allocators)

* create the concept of task groups -> 1 thread per group of tasks
